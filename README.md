# Fraudulent Claim Detection

## Problem Statement
Global Insure, a leading insurance company, processes thousands of claims annually. However, a significant percentage of these claims turn out to be fraudulent, resulting in considerable financial losses. The companyâ€™s current process for identifying fraudulent claims involves manual inspections, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Fraudulent claims are often detected too late in the process, after the company has already paid out significant amounts. Global Insure wants to improve its fraud detection process using data-driven insights to classify claims as fraudulent or legitimate early in the approval process. This would minimise financial losses and optimise the overall claims handling process.

## Models and Analysis

### Data Preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Handling missing values
- Data normalization and standardization
- Encoding categorical variables

### Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest

### Conclusion
1. Both the models are overfitting but Logistic regression is performing better compared to Random forest.
2. In context of business implications models is likely to catch most fraudulent claims but high false positives would make process inefficient.
